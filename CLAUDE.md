# Alagang MMC — Project Context

## What this is
A digital health intervention for Makati Medical Center (MMC) designed to address
process hurdles in patient care coordination. Built as an undergraduate special project
at UP Manila under the CeHRes Roadmap (Human-Centered Design framework).

The system streamlines the patient's journey **prior to consultation** — finding a
clinician, booking an appointment, and managing that appointment. It does not handle
billing, diagnostics, or post-consultation records.

---

## Mission nomenclature
- Backend missions: `B<number>-<letter>` (e.g. B1-A, B1-B, B1-C...)
- Frontend missions: `F<number>-<letter>` (e.g. F6-A, F6-B, F6-C...)
- Integration missions: `FB-<letter><number>` (e.g. FB-A1, FB-B3, FB-C2...)
- Patch missions append `-patch` to the parent (e.g. B1-A-patch, B1-A-patch-2)

## Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Vite |
| Backend | Flask + Flask-SQLAlchemy + Flask-Migrate |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 (transactional) |
| Containerization | Docker — all three services (frontend, backend, PostgreSQL) via `compose.yaml` in `/a-mmc_infra` |
| Reverse proxy | Planned — Nginx, SSL termination at proxy level, requires signed certs |
| Auth | flask-jwt-extended (JWT), bcrypt |
| Email | stdlib smtplib + email.mime — config-driven, Mailtrap for dev |
| CORS | flask-cors |
| Env management | python-dotenv |

**Scalability strategy:** Vertical only (increase instance spec). No horizontal scaling.
**Cost factors:** API usage, EBS storage, instance spec.
**Postgres connection pooling:** SQLAlchemy pool settings in `config.py` must be tuned
before production; avoid too many concurrent connections on a single instance.

## Routing
| Path | Component | Auth required |
|---|---|---|
| / | Redirects to /find | No |
| /find | FindDoctor.jsx | No |
| /find/triage | GuidedSearch.jsx | No |
| /doctors | Doctors.jsx | No |
| /clinician/:id | ClinicianProfile.jsx | No (book CTA gates at /login) |
| /login | Login.jsx | No |
| /register | Register.jsx | No |
| /staff/login | StaffLogin.jsx | No |
| /dashboard | PatientDashboard.jsx | Yes → /login?redirect=/dashboard |
| /dashboard/appointments | PatientAppointments.jsx | Yes |
| /dashboard/profile | UpdateProfile.jsx | Yes [STUB] |
| /clinician-dashboard | ClinicianDashboard.jsx | Yes → /staff/login?redirect=... |
| /clinician-dashboard/profile | ClinicianProfileManager.jsx | Yes |
| /clinician-dashboard/schedule | ScheduleManager.jsx | Yes |

**?redirect= chain (patient):** Unauthenticated patient hitting a gated page →
`/login?redirect=X` → `/register?redirect=X` → back to X after auth.

**?redirect= chain (staff):** Same pattern via `/staff/login?redirect=X`.

---

## Brand tokens (src/index.css)
```css
@theme {
  --color-primary: #1D409C;
  --color-primary-light: #8EA0CE;
  --color-accent: #CE1117;
  --color-dark: #303030;
  --color-white: #FFFFFF;
}
```
Use via Tailwind: `bg-[var(--color-primary)]`, `text-[var(--color-accent)]`, etc.
No arbitrary hex colors anywhere in the frontend.

---

## Database schema
PostgreSQL 16. All status/type fields use VARCHAR (not enums) for flexibility.
Migrations managed by Flask-Migrate (Alembic under the hood).
DB is transactional — commit/rollback boundaries must be deliberate, especially
for multi-table operations (e.g. booking + auto-block, reschedule slot swap).

### Tables

**CLINICIAN**
Core clinician profile. Owns several child tables.
- `clinician_id` PK, `title`, `first_name`, `middle_name`, `last_name`, `suffix`
- `department`, `specialty`
- `local_number` (internal extension, NOT a phone number), `room_number` (e.g. "Hall A Rm 230")
- `profile_picture` (string path/URL)
- `contact_phone`, `contact_email` (separate from login, but can be the same value)
- `login_email`, `login_password_hash`

**CLINICIAN_SCHEDULE**
One row per day (Mon–Sat). AM and PM slots are independent and nullable.
Uses 24hr TIME columns.
- `schedule_id` PK, `clinician_id` FK
- `day_of_week` (varchar: "Monday"–"Saturday")
- `am_start`, `am_end`, `pm_start`, `pm_end` (TIME, nullable)

**CLINICIAN_HMO**
Flexible array of HMO accreditations. Can be empty.
- `hmo_id` PK, `clinician_id` FK, `hmo_name`

**CLINICIAN_INFO**
Flexible "more information" entries (background, awards, etc.). Can be empty.
- `info_id` PK, `clinician_id` FK, `content` (text), `label` (varchar, e.g. "background")

**CLINICIAN_TIMESLOT**
Generated slots derived from CLINICIAN_SCHEDULE. Appointments reference these.
- `slot_id` PK, `clinician_id` FK
- `slot_date` (date), `start_time`, `end_time` (TIME)
- `status` (varchar: `available` | `blocked`)
- `max_patients` (int, nullable) — optional soft patient cap; auto-blocks slot when reached

**SECRETARY**
Assistive administrative role. Manages clinician profile, schedule, and appointments
on behalf of the clinician. Same system permissions as the clinician.
- `secretary_id` PK, `title`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `suffix`
- `contact_phone`, `contact_email`
- `login_email`, `login_password_hash`

**SECRETARY_CLINICIAN**
M2M junction between secretaries and clinicians. In practice mostly 1:1,
but the schema supports multiple secretaries per clinician.
- `id` PK, `secretary_id` FK, `clinician_id` FK

**PATIENT**
Required fields marked. Account required to book appointments.
- `patient_id` PK
- `last_name`*, `first_name`*, `middle_name`
- `birthday`* (date), `gender`*, `civil_status`, `nationality`, `religion`, `occupation`
- `mobile_number`*
- `next_of_kin_name`, `next_of_kin_relationship`, `next_of_kin_contact`
- `address_line_1`*, `province`*, `city`*, `barangay`*, `country`*
- `login_email`*, `login_password_hash`
- `sc_pwd_id_number`, `pwd_id_front` (string), `pwd_id_back` (string)
- `preferred_language`*, `culture`, `educational_attainment`*, `disability_type`

**APPOINTMENT**
A patient books an appointment within a clinician's timeslot.
- `appointment_id` PK
- `patient_id` FK, `clinician_id` FK, `slot_id` FK
- `consultation_date` (date)
- `chief_complaint` (varchar), `chief_complaint_description` (text)
- `payment_type` (varchar, free text)
- `status` (varchar: "pending", "accepted", "reschedule_requested", "rejected", "cancelled")
- `reschedule_reason` (text, nullable)
- `cancellation_reason` (text, nullable)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamp)

---

## Key design decisions
- **VARCHAR over ENUM** everywhere statuses or types appear — easier to extend without migrations
- **Child tables** for HMO and Info instead of arrays/JSONB — keeps queries clean and rows addable without schema changes
- **CLINICIAN_TIMESLOT** as a pre-generated slots table — slots are created from schedule on save (60-day rolling window); appointments reference a slot rather than raw times
- **SECRETARY_CLINICIAN** as a junction table — supports M2M even though 1:1 is the common case
- **No integration** with external MMC systems (iHIMS, EMR) — operates as a standalone system
- **No billing, diagnostics, or post-consultation data** — strictly pre-consultation coordination
- **Gender filter removed** from Doctors.jsx — field not present in Clinician schema

### Auth token strategy
- Access token: 60 minutes, returned in response body as `{ "access_token": "...", "user": {...} }`
- Refresh token: 7 days, set as `httpOnly` cookie named `refresh_token`
- No blocklist — logout clears cookie client-side only. `# TODO(security)` marked for production hardening
- Cookie settings: `httpOnly=True`, `secure=True` (False in DevelopmentConfig), `samesite="Lax"`
- Frontend stores access token in memory only (NOT localStorage — XSS risk)
- Silent refresh on AuthContext mount via `POST /api/auth/refresh`
- api.js 401 interceptor retries once with refreshed token; guards against infinite loop on /refresh itself

### Email strategy
- Provider: Mailtrap for dev/testing (no domain required), SendGrid for production
- All MAIL_* config is env-sourced — switching provider is a `.env` change only, zero code changes
- MAIL_FROM placeholder: `noreply@alagang-mmc.local` — update when domain is settled
- Failed email never affects DB transaction — all send calls are post-commit, wrapped in try/except
- `send_noshow_confirmation_prompt()` scaffolded but not wired — requires scheduler
  (`# TODO(scheduler)` marked in appointment_routes.py)

### Schedule change handling (timeslot invariant)
- `generate_slots()` is idempotent — it skips existing `(clinician, date, start_time)` keys and never deletes
- `generate_slots()` accepts `commit=False` param for parent-transaction participation
- `_time_to_minutes()` handles all three types: `timedelta`, `str` ("HH:MM" or "HH:MM:SS"), `datetime.time`
- If a `ClinicianSchedule` row is edited, `regenerate_slots_for_schedule_change()` handles cleanup:
  - **Safe orphans** (available, zero active appointments) → deleted automatically
  - **Stuck slots** (have active appointments) → returned to C/S for manual action
- Schedule-edit PATCH wraps schedule update + regeneration in a single atomic transaction
- Stuck slot list is surfaced in the response and in the ScheduleManager UI — does not block the save

### Slot model invariants (DO NOT CHANGE without design review)
- A slot (`CLINICIAN_TIMESLOT`) may hold **multiple appointments** — it is NOT 1:1 with a patient
- Slot `status` is **only ever written by C/S explicitly** (`available` → `blocked` and back), or auto-blocked when `max_patients` is reached. **Booking, rescheduling, and cancelling an appointment never write to slot status**
- `"booked"` is NOT a valid slot status. Valid values: `available | blocked`
- `max_patients` is nullable. When set, the slot auto-blocks after that many `accepted` appointments (opt-in soft capacity). Slot count is NOT shown to patients.

### Appointment status lifecycle
```
pending → accepted | rejected | cancelled
accepted → reschedule_requested | cancelled
reschedule_requested → accepted (new slot) | cancelled
rejected → (terminal)
cancelled → (terminal)
```

### Cancellation time rules
- **> 48 hours:** Any party may cancel freely; `cancellation_reason` required
- **24–48 hours:** Allowed with a warning in the API response
- **< 24 hours (patient):** Blocked — patient is directed to contact C/S directly
- **< 24 hours (C/S):** Cannot outright cancel — must use the `reschedule_requested` flow

### Reschedule rules
- Either patient or C/S may initiate `reschedule_requested`; `reschedule_reason` required
- C/S confirms by supplying `new_slot_id` when moving to `accepted`; new slot must be `available` and belong to the same clinician
- Old slot is **never touched** on reschedule — it may have other patients

### Patient overlap check
- Overlap test: `NOT (A.end <= B.start OR B.end <= A.start)` — touching boundaries are allowed
- Active statuses checked: `pending | accepted | reschedule_requested`
- Implemented in `app/services/appointment_service.py` — `has_overlap(patient_id, candidate_slot, exclude_appointment_id=None)`
- Wired into: `POST /api/appointments/` and reschedule-confirm branch of `PATCH /api/appointments/<id>`

### Transaction boundaries
All multi-table write operations are wrapped in try/except with db.session.rollback() on failure.
Verified routes:
- `POST /api/appointments/` — booking + potential auto-block
- `PATCH /api/appointments/<id>` — all status transition branches including flush + auto-block
- `DELETE /api/appointments/<id>` — cancellation
- `PATCH /api/clinicians/<id>/schedules/<schedule_id>` — schedule update + slot regeneration
- `DELETE /api/clinicians/<id>` — cascade deletes child rows
- `DELETE /api/secretaries/<id>` — cascade deletes SecretaryClinicianLink rows

### Secretary-clinician link route
- REST-style URL: `POST /api/secretaries/<secretary_id>/clinicians/<clinician_id>`
- No request body needed — both IDs are in the URL
- Unlink: `DELETE /api/secretaries/<secretary_id>/clinicians/<clinician_id>`

### Role-based clinician_id resolution (frontend)
Used in ClinicianDashboard, ClinicianProfileManager, and ScheduleManager:
- `role === "clinician"` → use `user.id` directly
- `role === "secretary"` → `GET /api/secretaries/<user.id>` → `clinician_ids[0]`

### Appointment serializer (_serialize in appointment_routes.py)
Returns nested objects for related entities:
- `clinician: { clinician_id, title, first_name, last_name, specialty, room_number }`
- `slot: { slot_id, slot_date, start_time }` (start_time sliced to HH:MM)
- `patient: { patient_id, first_name, last_name }` (nested object)
- `patient_first_name`, `patient_last_name` (flat fields, preserved for compatibility)

---

## Auth layer
`flask-jwt-extended` is fully wired. All three login endpoints are implemented.
- `app/services/auth_service.py` — `hash_password()`, `verify_password()`, `get_*_by_email()`, `build_identity()`
- `app/routes/auth_routes.py` — `/patient/login`, `/clinician/login`, `/secretary/login`, `/refresh`, `/logout`, `/me`
- All security hardening decisions marked `# TODO(security)`: blocklist, CSRF protection, rate limiting, brute-force protection

---

## User roles
| Role | What they do in the system |
|---|---|
| Patient | Browse clinicians, create account, book and manage appointments |
| Secretary | Manage clinician profile + schedule, accept/reschedule appointments |
| Clinician | Same permissions as secretary, takes system priority |
| System Administrator | User account management, audit trail, system monitoring |

Patients can browse clinicians without an account but must register to book.

### Docker
- ✅ a-mmc-postgres: up and running, all 10 tables migrated
- ✅ a-mmc-backend: up and running, smoke-tested
- ⏳ a-mmc-frontend: not yet up (collaborator)

### Known debt
- Frontend container not yet up — browser smoke test pending
- `UpdateProfile.jsx` is a stub
- Profile picture upload not wired (`# TODO(integration)` in ClinicianProfileManager)
- `send_noshow_confirmation_prompt()` not wired (needs scheduler — `# TODO(scheduler)`)
- `# TODO(security)` markers throughout auth: blocklist, CSRF, rate limiting, brute-force protection
- `triageLogic.js` routing logic pending domain expert validation
- `window.confirm()` still present in Register flow

---

## Next steps (priority order)
1. Collaborator brings up frontend container
2. Full browser smoke test: register → find clinician → book → C/S login → accept
3. Begin usability testing per CeHRes roadmap (SRET with stakeholder groups)
4. Wire profile picture upload endpoint
5. Address TODO(security) markers before any real user testing

## Conventions to follow
- App factory pattern via `create_app()` in `app/__init__.py`
- Config via classes in `config.py` (DevelopmentConfig, ProductionConfig)
- Models in `app/models/`, one file per domain entity
- Routes in `app/routes/`, one blueprint per domain entity
- Services in `app/services/`, pure logic functions (no route handling)
- Deferred imports inside service functions to avoid circular references
- All secrets and DB credentials via `.env` (never hardcoded)
- 24hr time throughout (TIME columns, API responses, frontend display) — no AM/PM anywhere
- Desktop-first layout that degrades gracefully to mobile
- Touch targets minimum 44px, base font minimum 16px — primary demographic is 60+ users
- Use brand tokens only — no arbitrary hex colors in frontend code
- All React hooks before any conditional returns (Rules of Hooks)
- No localStorage or sessionStorage for tokens — memory only
- Registration endpoints accept `"password"` field — hashed internally before storage
- Secretary-clinician link uses REST URL pattern, no request body
- All routes use trailing slash consistently (Flask redirects without it)

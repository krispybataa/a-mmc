# Alagang MMC — Project Context

## What this is
A digital health intervention for Makati Medical Center (MMC) designed to address
process hurdles in patient care coordination. Built as an undergraduate special project
at UP Manila under the CeHRes Roadmap (Human-Centered Design framework).

The system streamlines the patient's journey **prior to consultation** — finding a
clinician, booking an appointment, and managing that appointment. It does not handle
billing, diagnostics, or post-consultation records.

## Stack
| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React + Vite |
| Backend | Flask + Flask-SQLAlchemy + Flask-Migrate |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Containerization | Docker (compose.yaml in `/misc`) |
| CORS | flask-cors |
| Env management | python-dotenv |

**Postgres is available two ways:**
- Docker via `compose.yaml` (preferred for dev)
- Local install available as fallback

## Database schema
PostgreSQL. All status/type fields use VARCHAR (not enums) for flexibility.
Migrations managed by Flask-Migrate (Alembic under the hood).

### Tables

**CLINICIAN**
Core clinician profile. Owns several child tables.
- `clinician_id` PK, `title`, `first_name`, `middle_name`, `last_name`, `suffix`
- `department`, `specialty`
- `local_number` (internal extension, NOT a phone number), `room_number` (e.g. "Hall A Rm 230")
- `profile_picture` (string path/URL)
- `contact_phone`, `contact_email` (separate from login, but can be the same value)
- `login_email`, `login_password_hash`

**CLINICIAN_SCHEDULE**
One row per day (Mon–Sat). AM and PM slots are independent and nullable.
Uses 24hr TIME columns.
- `schedule_id` PK, `clinician_id` FK
- `day_of_week` (varchar: "Monday"–"Saturday")
- `am_start`, `am_end`, `pm_start`, `pm_end` (TIME, nullable)

**CLINICIAN_HMO**
Flexible array of HMO accreditations. Can be empty.
- `hmo_id` PK, `clinician_id` FK, `hmo_name`

**CLINICIAN_INFO**
Flexible "more information" entries (background, awards, etc.). Can be empty.
- `info_id` PK, `clinician_id` FK, `content` (text), `label` (varchar, e.g. "background")

**CLINICIAN_TIMESLOT**
Generated slots derived from CLINICIAN_SCHEDULE. Appointments reference these.
- `slot_id` PK, `clinician_id` FK
- `slot_date` (date), `start_time`, `end_time` (TIME)
- `status` (varchar: "available", "booked", "blocked")

**SECRETARY**
Assistive administrative role. Manages clinician profile, schedule, and appointments
on behalf of the clinician. Same system permissions as the clinician.
- `secretary_id` PK, `title`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `suffix`
- `contact_phone`, `contact_email`
- `login_email`, `login_password_hash`

**SECRETARY_CLINICIAN**
M2M junction between secretaries and clinicians. In practice mostly 1:1,
but the schema supports multiple secretaries per clinician.
- `id` PK, `secretary_id` FK, `clinician_id` FK

**PATIENT**
Required fields marked. Account required to book appointments.
- `patient_id` PK
- `last_name`*, `first_name`*, `middle_name`
- `birthday`* (date), `gender`*, `civil_status`, `nationality`, `religion`, `occupation`
- `mobile_number`*
- `next_of_kin_name`, `next_of_kin_relationship`, `next_of_kin_contact`
- `address_line_1`*, `province`*, `city`*, `barangay`*, `country`*
- `login_email`*, `login_password_hash`
- `sc_pwd_id_number`, `pwd_id_front` (string), `pwd_id_back` (string)
- `preferred_language`*, `culture`, `educational_attainment`*, `disability_type`

**APPOINTMENT**
A patient books an appointment within a clinician's timeslot.
A patient may have many appointments across many clinicians, so long as timeslots
do not overlap. Secretary or clinician can accept or request reschedule.
- `appointment_id` PK
- `patient_id` FK, `clinician_id` FK, `slot_id` FK
- `consultation_date` (date)
- `chief_complaint` (varchar), `chief_complaint_description` (text)
- `payment_type` (varchar, free text)
- `status` (varchar: "pending", "accepted", "rescheduled", "rejected", "cancelled")
- `reschedule_reason` (text, nullable)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamp)

---

## Key design decisions
- **VARCHAR over ENUM** everywhere statuses or types appear — easier to extend without migrations
- **Child tables** for HMO and Info instead of arrays/JSONB — keeps queries clean and rows addable without schema changes
- **CLINICIAN_TIMESLOT** as a generated slots table — appointment booking references a slot rather than raw times, preventing double-booking at the DB level
- **SECRETARY_CLINICIAN** as a junction table — supports M2M even though 1:1 is the common case
- **No integration** with external MMC systems (iHIMS, EMR) — operates as a standalone system
- **No billing, diagnostics, or post-consultation data** — strictly pre-consultation coordination

---

## User roles
| Role | What they do in the system |
|---|---|
| Patient | Browse clinicians, create account, book and manage appointments |
| Secretary | Manage clinician profile + schedule, accept/reschedule appointments |
| Clinician | Same permissions as secretary, takes system priority |
| System Administrator | User account management, audit trail, system monitoring |

Patients can browse clinicians without an account but must register to book.

## Where things stand
- ✅ Flask backend fully scaffolded (app factory, config, models, routes)
- ✅ All 8 schema tables implemented as SQLAlchemy models
- ✅ All 5 route blueprints scaffolded with full CRUD
- ✅ `.env.example` template in place
- ⏳ First migration not yet run — Postgres has not been touched
- ⏳ Auth layer not yet implemented (login endpoints, password hashing, JWT/session)
- ⏳ Frontend not yet integrated with backend
- **Next steps:**
  1. Copy `.env.example` → `.env`, fill in DB credentials
  2. Run `flask db init && flask db migrate -m "initial schema" && flask db upgrade`
  3. Smoke-test live routes against a running DB
  4. Implement auth (login endpoints + password hashing + JWT or session)
  5. Begin frontend integration once at least one API endpoint is live end-to-end

## Conventions to follow
- App factory pattern via `create_app()` in `app/__init__.py`
- Config via classes in `config.py` (DevelopmentConfig, ProductionConfig)
- Models in `app/models/`, one file per domain entity
- Routes in `app/routes/`, one blueprint per domain entity
- All secrets and DB credentials via `.env` (never hardcoded)
- 24hr time throughout (TIME columns, API responses, frontend display)
